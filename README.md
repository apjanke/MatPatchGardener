# MatPatchGardener

MatPatchGardener is a tool for creating and maintaining patches to [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html).
This is useful if you want to send suggested fixes when you submit Matlab bug reports to MathWorks.

It might also be useful if you want to do your own modifications to Matlab by "shadowing" its own definitions.
But do that at your own risk; it is an unsupported configuration.

## INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WARNING

WARNING! Matlab is proprietary, commerical software. Its contents are the intellectual property of MathWorks. The patches you create are derived works of Matlab, and will also contain MathWorks' intellectual property. Do not give access to your patches to anyone unless you have verified that they have a currently active Matlab license!

## Requirements

MatPatchGardener requires the latest release of Matlab.
(There's not much point in producing patches for older releases.)
As of this writing, that's Matlab R2019b.
